# MentalSpace Design Philosophy

## Design Philosophy

**Color Palette**: Soft, therapeutic tones with low saturation. Primary colors include sage green (#8FBC8F), soft lavender (#E6E6FA), warm cream (#F5F5DC), and gentle gray (#F8F8FF). These colors promote calm and emotional safety.

**Typography**: Clean, readable sans-serif fonts. Inter for headings and body text, with careful attention to readability and emotional tone. Font sizes optimized for mobile-first experience.

**Visual Language**: Minimalist, supportive, and non-clinical aesthetic. Emphasis on whitespace, gentle curves, and organic shapes that evoke comfort and trust.
